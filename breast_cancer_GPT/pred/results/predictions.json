This detection is based on computer analysis and should be reviewed by a qualified specialist for further evaluation and interpretation.\n\n**Confidence Score:**\n\nThe confidence score for this detection is 41%, indicating some uncertainty. Reasons for uncertainty include the complexity of the image and the possibility of other explanations for the detected abnormality.\n\n**Possible Explanations:**\n\nTwo possible explanations for this finding are:\n\n1. A benign cyst or other non-cancerous growth\n2. A neoplasm (tumor) that may be cancerous\n\n**Model Limitations:**\n\nThe algorithm is not perfect and may not always accurately detect tumors. Other factors, such as image quality and patient-specific characteristics, can also affect the accuracy of the detection.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nRecommend specialist review to further evaluate and interpret this finding. Further imaging or other diagnostic tests may be considered to gather more information.\n\n**No Urgent Features Detected:**\n\nThis detection does not indicate any urgent or red-flag features that require immediate clinical attention."

Additionally, the algorithm is not capable of differentiating between benign and malignant lesions without further evaluation.\n\n**Possible Explanations:**\n\nThis finding could be due to a variety of reasons, including a benign cyst or a neoplasm. A qualified specialist would need to review the image and consider additional information, such as patient history and clinical presentation, to determine the most likely explanation.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nRecommend specialist review to further evaluate this finding and determine its significance.
